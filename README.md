This repository contains a diverse range of data analytics projects that I have worked on, covering multiple aspects of data analysis, including:

- **Data Cleaning and Wrangling**: Using Python libraries like Pandas and NumPy to preprocess raw data for analysis.
- **Data Visualization**: Building interactive dashboards in Power BI and Tableau to present actionable insights.
- **SQL Queries**: Writing complex SQL queries for data extraction, manipulation, and analysis from relational databases.
- **Predictive Analytics**: Implementing machine learning models in Python to forecast demand, optimize inventory, and more.
- **Automation**: Using Power Automate and Power Apps to create efficient workflows and automate business processes.

Each project includes detailed explanations, code, and visualizations to demonstrate my approach to solving real-world data challenges.*
